# Voice Pathology Classification and Detection

## Inspiration for the project

In pandemicera, in-person appointemts with doctors have become less attainable. Especially for older and vulnerable people.
People of age have voice pathologies more often than younger generation, and those pathologies are often treated as "voice aging". But in fact, in most cases there are root pathologies that require proper examination.

My project is intended to build a foundation for pathology prediction based on voice records, so that older people can pre-record their voice in special format and the algorithm will predict if they need to see a doctor or not.
